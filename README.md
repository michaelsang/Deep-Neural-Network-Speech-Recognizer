STEP 2: Compare the Models
The submission includes a detailed analysis of why different models might perform better than others.

Great! This is a pretty good analysis of each individual model. An improvement would be to explain why different models perform better than others. For example, what is it about the nature of a CNN on this problem that leads to extreme overfitting? Additionally, you can look at things such as overfitting, the number of parameters that need to be tuned, and the training time for each individual model and compare these in a table.

STEP 2: Final Model
The submission trained the model for at least 20 epochs, and none of the loss values in model_end.pickle are undefined. The trained weights for the model specified in final_model are stored in model_end.h5.

Well done! Your notebook shows that you trained final_model for 20 epochs. All the loss values are defined and numeric (stored in model_end.pickle ). Your validation loss ends at 171.3560

The submission includes a sample_models.py file with a completed final_model module containing a final architecture that is not identical to any of the previous architectures.

Well done! Your submission includes a sample_models.py with a completed final_model module containing a different architecture.

The submission includes a detailed description of how the final model architecture was designed.

Nice job! The submission includes a detailed description of how the final model architecture was designed. Your reasoning is logical here.
